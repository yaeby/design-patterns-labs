## Objectives:

* Get familiar with the Structural DPs;
* Choose a specific domain;
* Implement at least 3 SDPs for the specific domain;

## Used Design Patterns:

* Composite
* Decorator
* ...

## Implementation
To cover the objectives of this laboratory work and understand what are structural design patterns and how do they work, I developed the inventory-management to different niches and in the creation of new feeatures I implemented some structural design patterns.

1. ### Composite

I modified the way the project stores the data, now we use mySql, where we created a database for our project. So, once we have a database, we have to connect to it, and to have only one existing connection we use the Singleton Design Pattern.


2. ### Decorator

In my project we have some entities, and to create this objects step by step and at the same time generic ones, I implemented a generic design pattern.


3. ### ...

To run the operations of our project, we have specific command classes for each command, and all these classes implement the command interface, for example:

## Conclusions / Screenshots / Results
In conclusion, the task of this laboratory work was done successfully, implementing these creational design patterns, making our project more simple, abstract and robust. The creational design pattern gave the opportunity to develop vastly this project, maintaining the solid principle and its clarity.
